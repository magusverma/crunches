There is a relationship schema of a social networking site. There are three tables in it - :


1. Person - This table contains the following columns: P_Id(Person id - Primary Key), Name, Age, Gender


2. Friends - This table contains three columns (Id - Primary Key, P_Id1, P_Id2) - ‘P_Id1’ and ‘P_Id 2’ are friends (if ‘a’ is friend with ‘b’ then ‘b’ is also friend with ‘a’).


3. Likes - This table also contains three columns (Id - Primary Key, P_Id1, P_Id2) -  ‘P_Id1’ likes ‘P_Id2’(if ‘a’ likes ‘b’, this does not imply that ‘b’ also likes ‘a’).
